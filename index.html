        <p style="text-align:justify; max-width:600px; margin:auto; padding-bottom:30px;">Material Resource is a non-profit, knowledge, nature and art enterprise, based in the River Shannon Callows Special Area of Conservation (SAC). In central Ireland, North of Lough Derg the River Shannon has a very shallow gradient and in parts regularly floods its banks. The resulting wet grassland area, known as the Shannon Callows, is renowned for its wild birds, insects and plant species.</p>

Apart from getting a sense of the extent of flooding we were able to use the survey imagery to identify the houses's different sized chimney pots.</p>

        <h6><b>Wild Clay Workshop</b></h6>
        <p><img style="width:100%" src="./images/clayfiring.jpg">Rivers and lakes from prehistoric times now covered by bog provide the essential muds favourable for brickmaking and roof and floor tile making. A hand-made brick industry thrived in Clonown, South Roscommon in the 19th century and provided bricks for many buildings in Athlone. Between Drum and Clonown brickmaking was still active until 1924. Using local clays this workshop leads participants through the entire process of digging local clay from the ground, processing it, hand building it and firing ceramic work on site.</p>

        <p><img style="width:100%" src="./images/peacockbutterflymeadowsweet.jpg">Material Resource is located in the Special Area of Conservation River Shannon Callows SAC. Here the River Shannon has a very shallow gradient and in parts regularly floods its banks. The resulting wet grassland area, known as the Shannon Callows, has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in these islands with Lapwing, Redshank, Curlew, Sandpiper and Godwit living there. Many species of migrant wildbirds are also frequent visitors while otters, fox and ferret mink are common residents.</p>

        <h6><b>On the Water</b></h6>
        <p><img style="width:100%" src="./images/paddleboard.jpg">Push off through lily pads and experience the Callows from the water. Inflatable paddle boards are ideal for river paddle boarding due to their durability and lightness. They can withstand collisions with rocks and hard surfaces reducing the likelihood of damage. You can use bungee cords to secure your gear on the board. A personal flotation device or a life jacket, a waterproof phone pouch and a leash to ensure you don’t get separated from your paddleboard are all necessary. Try not to disturb the wildlife and bring home your rubbish.</p>
