        <p style="text-align:justify; max-width:600px; margin:auto; padding-bottom:30px;">Material Resource is a non-profit, knowledge, nature and art enterprise, based in the River Shannon Callows Special Area of Conservation (SAC). In central Ireland, North of Lough Derg the River Shannon has a very shallow gradient and in parts regularly floods its banks. The resulting wet grassland area, known as the Shannon Callows, is renowned for its wild birds and wildlife generally.</p>

        <h6><b>Drone Survey</b></h6>
        <p>Irish Aviation Authority certified Drone/SUA company <a href="https://www.obcs.ie" style="color:#777777"> On Board Camera Systems (OBCS)</a>completed an aerial survey of both locations of our site. Apart from getting a sense of the extent of flooding we were able to use the survey imagery to identify the houses's different sized chimney pots.</p>

        <h6><b>Wild Clay Workshop</b></h6>
        <p>Rivers and lakes from prehistoric times now covered by bog provide the essential muds favourable for brickmaking and roof and floor tile making. A hand-made brick industry thrived in Clonown, South Roscommon in the 19th century and provided bricks for many buildings in Athlone. In Carricknaughton, between Drum and Clonown brickmaking was still active until 1924. Delaney in his work on the Gillen brickyards identified a number of words used in the production process, for example Mine : the place from which the year’s supply of clay was dug, four yards wide and a hundred yards long.</p>

        <h6><b>Plants and Animals</b></h6>
        <p>Material Resource is located in the Special Area of Conservation River Shannon Callows SAC. Here the River Shannon has a very shallow gradient and in parts regularly floods its banks. The resulting wet grassland area, known as the Shannon Callows, has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in these islands with Lapwing, Redshank, Curlew, Sandpiper and Godwit living there. Many species of migrant wildbirds are also frequent visitors while otters, fox and ferret mink are common residents.</p>

        <h6><b>On the Water</b></h6>
        <p>Push off through lilly pads and experience the Callows from the water.</p>
        <p>An inflatable paddle board is often preferred for river paddle boarding due to its durability and lightness. They can withstand collisions with rocks and hard surfaces, reducing the likelihood of damage. Necesssary is a personal flotation device or a life jacket, bungee cords to secure your gear on the board, and a leash to ensure you don’t get separated from your paddleboard. Finally, always respect nature when you're out on the river. Try not to disturb wildlife and carry out any rubbish you bring in.</p>
